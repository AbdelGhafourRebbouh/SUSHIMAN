<h1># 🍣 Sushiman </h1>

A modern and responsive landing page for **Sushiman**, a sushi-themed restaurant website.  
This project was built as part of following an online tutorial (*Creating a Sushi-Themed Website: HTML & CSS Guide* on YouTube).  
It helped me sharpen my **HTML5** and **CSS3** skills in layout, responsive design, and UI styling.

## 🌱 Learning Notes

This project was created during my **front-end development journey**.  
It allowed me to practice **semantic HTML**, responsive layouts, and consistent visual styling.  

Now, I’m focused on **backend development with .NET (C#)** to become a **desktop developer**, while also keeping my **C++** experience strong.  
This repo remains part of my growth journey and represents how I started with front-end practice projects.
