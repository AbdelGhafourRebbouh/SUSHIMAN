## 🌱 Learning Notes

This project was created during my **front-end development journey**.  
It allowed me to practice **semantic HTML**, responsive layouts, and consistent visual styling.  

Now, I’m focused on **backend development with .NET (C#)** to become a **desktop developer**, while also keeping my **C++** experience strong.  
This repo remains part of my growth journey and represents how I started with front-end practice projects.
